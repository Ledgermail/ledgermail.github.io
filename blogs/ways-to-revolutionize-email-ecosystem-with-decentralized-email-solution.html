                        channel and it is not evolving and innovating as
                        expected. We are still using email transfer protocols
                        which were designed in 1982 and were last updated in
                        2008. We are experiencing a monopoly of big tech giants
                        using their email platforms with little or no
                        encryption, privacy, and security.

                        To eliminate these pain points and revolutionize the
                        Email Ecosystem completely, the Decentralization of
                        Blockchain technology stands as the main alternative.

                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        We can begin by replacing existing and traditional email
                        transfer protocols such as SMTP/IMAP which are
                        cumbersome and hackable in nature with Blockchain
                        Technology.
                    </div>

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        With Blockchain, we can store the emails/messages on
                        shared ledgers similar to any crypto transaction. It
                        will easily replace current email transfer protocols
                        with Blockchain and we can inherit all the benefits of
                        Blockchain technology here which is getting recognized
                        as one of the most secure and trustworthy technologies

                        2. Encrypting Emails with Cryptography

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        Current email platforms do provide Transport Layer
                        Security but are it enough to secure your emails from
                        breaches?
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        In TSL Encryption, the connection between Sender and
                        Receiver is encrypted which is subjected to the receiver
                        having TSL enabled at his end. In this way, one email
                        server can send a message to another email server and
                        TSL can encrypt the connection.
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        But the only the connection is encrypted in this case,
                        payload data or actual email content is still
                        un-encrypted which makes it vulnerable to breach.
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        To cope with this problem, we can leverage open source
                        Cryptography Algorithms such as xSalsa20 Stream Cipher
                        Algorithms, which can cryptographically encrypt the
                        messages and make it next to impossible to decrypt with
                        external intervention and breach.

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        Although current email providers mention they donâ€™t scan
                        email content exclusively to collect information for
                        their advertising machines, data from our accounts is
                        used to serve advertisements in our mailbox. By changing
                        the Privacy Policies of these open-source platforms,
                        they are collecting as much information as they can,
                        which is compromising our privacy to great extent.

                        With Blockchain and Decentralization where all the data
                        is encrypted and stored on a distributed network, no
                        single authority can dictate our data and we can
                        experience enhanced privacy through the same.

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        Current email providers have centralized storage where
                        all the information and data is stored which makes it
                        vulnerable to a single point of failure. We have seen
                        several instances in the past where such centralized
                        servers are compromised and suffered through
                        catastrophic failure, accidentally burn to the ground,
                        and even seized by a third party.

                        With Decentralization, where nodes are distributed along
                        with the network and encrypted documents are stored on a
                        decentralized IPFS network, we are eliminating this
                        possibility of a single point of failure and increasing
                        the security layers through Decentralization.
