                        LedgerMail is the Pingala Software powered, most
                        prominent, and the world’s first Decentralized Email
                        Service that combines the power of blockchain, XDPoS
                        consensus, cryptographic algorithms, and zero trust
                        mechanism with a mission of Protecting the Digital

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        After having a thorough analysis of existing legacy
                        email providers, the LedgerMail team has pointed out
                        that email users are not only manipulated and controlled
                        by centralized governance, but users are left with zero
                        privacy, and security. They are also thrown into the
                        hands of many hackers where it is easy to launch
                        cyber-attacks via fraudulent emails.

                    <div class="blog-view-content-2">
                        “Emails are part of our day-to-day communications and
                        yet it is the least evolved technology vertical. With
                        the introduction of the Decentralized Email Solution,
                        now users will have complete control of their data
                        without worrying about their email security and
                        privacy.”

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        The ever-growing LedgerMail platform will replace
                        traditional email transfer protocols like IMAP/SMTP.
                        However, LedgerMail uses blockchain technology in which
                        cryptographically encrypted messages & attachments are
                        stored on shared blockchain ledgers.

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        In detail, each email transferred is confirmed and
                        validated like a blockchain transaction. In order to
                        bring the utmost level of security and create a
                        tamper-proof decentralized email environment.

                        Mr. Suraj Mulla, a Vice President of Sales & Marketing
                        at Pingala Software said that LedgerMail will reinvent
                        the Legacy email system. Even more, through customized
                        LedgerMail UI, LedgerMail enhances a hassle-free and
                        seamless user experience.

                    <div class="blog-view-content">
                        Moreover, LedgerMail will not ask users to change their
                        email ID or domain like other email security providers.
                        Users can change their Email ecosystem, however, without
                        changing their Email ID, and be part of the LegerMail.
