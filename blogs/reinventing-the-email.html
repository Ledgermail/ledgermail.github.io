            Human history is filled with anecdotes of inventions and
            reinventions. We have witnessed an array of inventions right from
            the wheel, animal carts, the telephone, television, internet, world
            wide web, to the reinvention of the same through motors, trains,
            smartphones, smart TVs, decentralized internet and a list goes on
            and on. These reinventions have made our world a better place to
            live while leveraging disruptive technologies.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            Now we are experiencing a rapid evolution as we enter into an era of
            Web 3.0 where applications are built upon disruptive blockchain
            technology. The core foundation of Web 3.0 is laid through the
            principles of decentralization, censorship-resistance, peer-to-peer
            exchange, and giving control back to the users for data sovereignty.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            As we progress into this new world of decentralization, it is
            imperative to focus on the requirements of User 2.0 which believes
            in protecting its digital rights through data security, privacy, and
            prevention from online attacks. The tech-savvy millennials and Gen
            Zs want an uncompromised ecosystem where they can own their digital
            identity with a belief in the democratic management of their data
            privacy.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            Considering the same, a Dubai-based organization the LedgerFi IT
            Solutions has launched the world's first decentralized email
            solution called the LedgerMail. A blockchain email service that
            replaces the traditional way of exchanging emails through IMAP/SMTP,
            and a centralized legacy email service provider with cutting-edge
            blockchain technology. LedgerMail is disrupting the email ecosystem
            with a vision of protecting the digital rights of Web 3.0 users and
            providing the highest level of security, privacy, cryptographic
            encryption, and prevention from email attacks in a decentralized
            way.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            LedgerMail - a blockchain email solution is obviating the need to
            rely on traditional email service providers by providing user
            privacy, reliability, and authenticity with its disruptive email
            platform. LedgerMail allows users to have complete governance of
            their data while enabling a peer-to-peer transfer of emails through
            a decentralized network of nodes distributed across the globe.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            The traditional email service providers rely on the cumbersome &
            obsolete email transfer protocols of IMAP and SMTP. Few email
            security services claim to provide end-to-end encryption but
            centralized governance and limitations of the SMTP port 25 which
            accepts only plain text format or ASCII characters expose these
            false claims.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            The decentralized email service of LedgerMail leverages
            cryptographic algorithms for encrypting messages, files, and
            attachments. LedgerMail is also entering into a strategic
            partnership with a decentralized cloud storage provider which will
            ensure all the attachments are encrypted, fragmented, and stored on
            a distributed network of the nodes.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            LedgerMail brings true authenticity to an individual email as it
            encrypts the message and stores it on the immutable ledger of the
            blockchain network. This eliminates the possibilities of email
            tampering and email spoofing which is quite common with legacy email
            services. Even the email security service providers cannot limit
            these tampering & spoofing attacks. These email security services
            only encrypt the body of the email, the email header which comprises
            the email ID, timestamp, IP address, and the subject line is still
            unencrypted. The blockchain email service of LedgerMail eliminates
            this possibility through immutability.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            Now it's time to reinvent emails and adopt a blockchain email
            service that inherits all the capabilities of this disruptive
            technology. LedgerMail operates on a hybrid blockchain platform of
            the XDC Network which leverages the XDPoS 2.0 consensus mechanism
            for lightning-fast speed, military-grade security, forensic
            controls, and accountability.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            This blockchain email service is equipped with all the components of
            the Web 3.0 protocols while ensuring to provide a simplistic,
            interoperable, and futuristic platform to its users. A simple
            sign-up process followed by a user-friendly UI allows users to
            experience a seamless interface backed by cryptographic security.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            LedgerMail is not only limited to individual users of the web 3.0
            ecosystem, but this blockchain email service is catering to global
            enterprises and SMEs as well. Now we all can be part of a close-knit
            ecosystem of decentralized communication to exchange our digital
            assets without getting manipulated, controlled, or governed by a
            centralized intermediary.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            Since its inception, the decentralized email service of LedgerMail
            has successfully onboarded more than a million users along with big
