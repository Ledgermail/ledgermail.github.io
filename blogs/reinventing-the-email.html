                        disruptive blockchain technology. The core foundation of
                        Web 3.0 is laid through the principles of
                        decentralization, censorship-resistance, peer-to-peer
                        exchange, and giving control back to the users for data
                        sovereignty.

                        header which comprises the email ID, timestamp, IP
                        address, and the subject line is still unencrypted. The
