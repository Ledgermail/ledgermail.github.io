            With the adoption of Web 3.0 and Industrial Revolution 4.0 lead by
            DLT, Decentralized Applications, and DeFi solutions, we are entering
            into a new era of communication where we are no longer supposed to
            compromise our Digital Rights.

          <div class="blog-view-content">
            One of the major technological verticals which every individual and
            organization use in their day-to-day life but still doesnâ€™t think
            through around compromising their security, privacy, or even giving
            control to third parties to manage their data and scan it for
            advertising machines.

          <div class="blog-view-content-2 mt-8">
            1. Current email transfer protocols are obsolete, cumbersome, and
            hackable in nature!
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            As we know, current email transfer protocols such as IMAP/SMTP are
            very old-fashioned and were designed in 1982 and were last updated
            in 2008. Having such obsolete and cumbersome email transfer
            protocols, resulted in an easy target for hackers to breach through
            these protocols and launch email attacks for fraudulent demands.

            is considered to be one of the most secure technology in the current
            age.

            inherits all the features and capabilities of Blockchain and DLT to
            build a Decentralized network where messages are stored on shared
            ledgers of Blockchain.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content-2 mt-8">
            2. Security provided by current email ecosystem is inadequate and
            easy target for sophisticated hackers!
          </div>

          <div class="blog-view-content">
            Though current email providers try to provide some kind of security
            but when underlying mechanism of email transfer is cumbersome,
            sophisticated hackers can easily spoof and manipulate email headers
            to impersonate as a higher management in an organization and try to
            launch fraudulent attacks.

              LedgerMail </a
            >, each email ID is assigned with unique wallet ID which cannot be
            spoofed and email transfer between sender and receiver is highly
            isolated where both the parties can encrypt/decrypt their messages
            and attachments through asymmetric key sharing mechanism.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content-2 mt-8">
            3. User privacy getting compromised through control of third-party
            email providers!
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            We have seen several instances where email providers try to scan the
            content of your emails to feed data to their advertising machines
            and even user account data is leveraged to deploy personalized ads
            on social media and search engines. User privacy has become an issue
            of imperative importance since we are experiencing such policies
            being rolled out frequently.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            To avoid this issue,
            <a
              class="blog-view-link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://ledgermail.io/"
            >
              LedgerMail
            </a>
            works in complete isolation where only the sender and receiver can
            see the messages which are cryptographically encrypted and stored on
            a decentralized network. With introduction of asymmetric key sharing
            mechanism,
            <a
              class="blog-view-link"

            </a>
            ensures to encrypt data transferred over public ledgers and only
            commuting parties are able to access this data.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content-2 mt-8">
            4. Centralized storage gives centralized control to third-party
            email providers!
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            Current email transfer systems work on centralized storage where all
            user data, messages, and attachments are stored on centralized
            servers. Having such centralization of data may result in a single
            point of failure, accidental burn to the ground, or even being
            seized by third parties. Along with this, centralized storage allows
            these email providers to have control over the ecosystem and
            manipulate it as needed.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            On contrary,
            <a
              class="blog-view-link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://ledgermail.io/"

              LedgerMail
            </a>
            builds a Decentralized Email Ecosystem where no single authority is
            responsible to manage user data. Having distributed nodes across the
            network also ensures to enhance the level of security and makes it
            impossible for hackers to get control of this network.
          </div>
          <div class="blog-view-content">
            In a nutshell,
